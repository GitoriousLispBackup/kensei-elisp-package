figure out if mail body has html content
html2text for rendering html content as ascii
render images - just search for image: links
** TODO write/send new email
*** new perspective: single page
*** use text or rmail mode?
*** must handle all to/from headers when replying/reply to all

** TODO archive mail
** TODO tag mail
** TODO attachments
*** download/save attachment
*** attach one or more files
** TODO search

*** set up different perspective for searches: top list, bottom current selected
*** sort criteria, reuse same fields as in general emails list
*** Check out possible external tools for parsing and searching mboxes
mu
*** or build my own search stuff
**** Can we get away with a simple grep across the imap mailbox?
**** Or do we need to index it all somehow?

** TODO per-account signatures
* UX [0/14]
** TODO handle account id/name with spaces
*** quote it everywhere before sent to the backend?
** TODO make it extensible with hooks all the obvious places

** TODO colorize elements using font-face keywords etc
   Check how it looks both in default theme and solarized+zenburn

** TODO set up context-specific menu bar items
** TODO make window setup more robust
   - Always start with single window (C-x 1) before setting up the rest
   - Dont split email list up into email contents before selecting a mail
   - Only split if not already showing email
   - Make possible to remove email window (until next time email is selected)
** TODO make message lists sortable on multiple fields
** TODO make message lists threadable
** TODO improved imap synchronization
*** asynch/background
*** perform synch in chunks of X seconds, show progress if possible
**** show some progress if likely to hang:
(let ((progress-reporter
       (make-progress-reporter "Updating mailbox..."
                               0  100)))
  (dotimes (k 100)
    (sit-for 0.1)
    (progress-reporter-update progress-reporter k))
  (progress-reporter-done progress-reporter))
** TODO handle large inboxes (thousands of entries) (paging?)
Render XYZ first entries
Links at bottom: "Show next 100 | Show next 1000 | Show all"
** TODO auto-complete email recipients (should work with IDO etc)
*** Approach 1: build up "quasi address book" in backend by parsing all the mails currently available offline
*** Approach 2: or, can we interace with google adress book somehow?
Just fricken use goobook for getting this
** TODO unified view of inbox and some other shared gmail folders (Sent Mail etc)
** TODO automate setup of dependencies, config, accounts
*** in kensei-start: check dependencies, guide installation of packages/gem if necessary
*** on kensei-start: if no accounts: "no accounts found - would you like to add a gmail account?"
** TODO add
** TODO how much work is general imap support, not just gmail?
